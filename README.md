# AutoKuro QB

**Tactical Reconnaissance Pipeline for Bug Bounty Hunters**

AutoKuro QB is an automated vulnerability scanning framework designed for tactical reconnaissance. It efficiently chains industry-standard tools (Nuclei, Naabu, Feroxbuster, etc.) into a smart, resilient, and asynchronous pipeline.

This version features a **Hardware Scaling Engine** that allows the tool to run efficiently on devices ranging from mobile phones (Termux) to high-performance Cloud VPS servers. It utilizes an **Asynchronous Orchestrator** to execute scanning tasks in parallel without blocking, alongside a **Surgical Scanning Logic** that intelligently categorizes targets to maximize accuracy and minimize noise.

## Key Features

* **Asynchronous Orchestration:** Runs multiple scanning modules (Port Scanning, Cloud Enum, Tech Detect) in parallel to significantly reduce scan time while maintaining a sequential-style user interface.
* **Smart Surgical Scanning:** Automatically categorizes subdomains into 'API', 'Static', and 'Dynamic' groups. It then applies specific scan strategies to each group (e.g., API-specific payloads for APIs, Misconfig checks for Static assets), reducing false positives and wasted resources.
* **WAF Kill Switch:** Proactive protection system that continuously monitors tool output for WAF block signatures (e.g., Cloudflare Ray ID, Captcha). If a block is detected, the tool executes an immediate emergency stop to preserve IP reputation and prevent bans.
* **Adaptive Resilience:** Features a self-healing mechanism that detects tool failures or timeouts. If a tool fails (e.g., due to temporary network issues), the engine automatically retries with reduced rate limits and concurrency.
* **Memory Safe Architecture:** Utilizes Python Generators and an internal SQLite database for deduplication and file processing, ensuring stability even on low-RAM devices processing millions of URLs.
* **Hardware Scaling:** Adjusts thread counts, concurrency, and rate limits dynamically based on the hardware profile (Mobile, Desktop, VPS).
* **Streamed Recon:** Uses Unix piping (Subfinder -> Httpx) to process subdomains immediately without blocking I/O.
* **Context-Aware Intelligence:** Detects the target technology stack (Springboot, Laravel, etc.) and injects relevant tags into the vulnerability scanner.
* **Anti-WAF & Stealth:** Implements TLS spoofing (JA3 bypass) and randomized user-agents.
* **Real-time Notifications:** Integrated Telegram alerts for critical findings.

## Prerequisites & Installation

This tool requires **Python 3** and **Go (Golang)**. There is no automated setup script; you must install the underlying tools manually and ensure they are in your system path.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Kitsunesan13/AutoKuroQB.git](https://github.com/Kitsunesan13/AutoKuroQB.git)
cd AutoKuro

```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3. Install External Tools (Manual)

Install the following tools via `go install` or `apt`.

**Required Go Tools:**

* **Nuclei** (v3.0+ required): `github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei`
* **Subfinder:** `github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder`
* **Naabu:** `github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/v2/cmd/naabu`
* **Httpx:** `github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx` (Ensure binary is named `httpx-toolkit` on Kali).
* **Katana:** `github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/cmd/katana`
* **Gau:** `github.com/bp0lr/gau/v2/cmd/gau`
* **Dalfox:** `github.com/hahwul/dalfox/v2`
* **Trufflehog:** `github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/v3`

**Other Required Tools:**

* **Feroxbuster:** Install via binary release or `apt install feroxbuster`.
* **ParamSpider:** Clone from GitHub and install via pip.
* **SecLists:** Ensure wordlists are at `/usr/share/wordlists/seclists`.

### 4. Verify Installation

Run the built-in validator to ensure all tools are detected.

```bash
python3 main.py --verify

```

## Configuration

Edit `config/config.yaml` to configure Telegram credentials, timeouts, and priority keywords.

```yaml
telegram:
  enabled: true
  bot_token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
  chat_id: "YOUR_CHAT_ID"

# Global timeout for each tool in seconds
timeout: 600
# Enable auto-retry with reduced speed on failure
adaptive_retry: true

priority_keywords:
  - admin
  - api
  - dev
  - internal

```

## API Integration (Recommended)

To significantly increase subdomain discovery, it is highly recommended to configure external API keys (Shodan, Censys, etc.) for `subfinder`. AutoKuro QB will automatically leverage these keys without any code changes.

1. Locate the Subfinder provider configuration file.

* Linux/VPS: `$HOME/.config/subfinder/provider-config.yaml`

2. Add your API keys to the file:

```yaml
shodan:
  - "YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY"

censys:
  - "YOUR_CENSYS_APP_ID:YOUR_CENSYS_SECRET"

```

## Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
python3 main.py start -d <TARGET_DOMAIN> -m <MODE> -hw <PROFILE> [FLAGS]

```

### 1. Operational Modes (-m / --mode)

Defines the **strategy** of the scan.

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ghost** | Slow, Anti-JA3, Rate-limited. | WAF-protected targets (Cloudflare/Akamai). |
| **Ranger** | Balanced speed and depth. | Standard VDP scanning (Default). |
| **Blitz** | Aggressive, Noisy, No delays. | CTFs, Internal Networks, or IP ranges. |

### 2. Hardware Profiles (-hw / --hardware)

Defines the **intensity** (threads/speed) based on your device.

| Profile | Multiplier | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mobile** | 0.4x | Low resource usage. Prevents overheating on phones/Termux. |
| **Desktop** | 1.0x | Standard usage for Laptops or PC Workstations. |
| **VPS** | 2.5x | High concurrency. Utilizes cloud server bandwidth. |

### Examples

**Standard Desktop Scan**

```bash
python3 main.py start -d example.com -m ranger -hw desktop

```

**Aggressive Scan on High-End VPS**

```bash
python3 main.py start -d example.com -m blitz -hw vps

```

**Stealth Scan on Mobile (Termux)**

```bash
python3 main.py start -d example.com -m ghost -hw mobile

```

**Proxy Scan**

```bash
python3 main.py start -d example.com -p "[http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)"

```

### Performance Tip

If running on Linux, set the output directory to `/dev/shm` (RAMDisk) to significantly reduce Disk I/O and increase speed.

```bash
python3 main.py start -d example.com -o /dev/shm/scans

```

## Output Structure

Results are organized by domain and date in the `results/` directory.
