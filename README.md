# AutoKuro QB

**Tactical Reconnaissance Pipeline for Bug Bounty Hunters**

AutoKuro QB is an automated vulnerability scanning framework designed for tactical reconnaissance. It chains together industry-standard tools (Nuclei, Naabu, Feroxbuster, etc.) into a smart, resilient pipeline. It features anti-WAF capabilities, smart target filtering, and a checkpoint system to resume interrupted scans.

## Key Features

* **Smart Recon:** Automatically filters priority targets (admin, api, dev) to optimize resource usage.
* **Checkpoint System:** Detects existing output files and skips completed steps. Scans can be resumed at any time.
* **Anti-WAF & Stealth:** Implements TLS spoofing (JA3 bypass), rate limiting, and random user-agents to evade detection.
* **Multi-Mode Operation:** Three distinct operational modes (Ghost, Ranger, Blitz) for different engagement rules.
* **Proxy Support:** Full HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy support across all underlying tools for anonymity.
* **Real-time Notifications:** Integrated Telegram alerts for critical findings and scan progress.
* **Dependency Validator:** Built-in health check to ensure all required binaries are installed.

## Prerequisites & Installation

This tool requires **Python 3** and **Go (Golang)**. Since there is no setup script, you must install the underlying tools manually and ensure they are available in your system `$PATH`.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoKuro.git
cd AutoKuro

```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3. Install External Tools (Manual)

You must install the following tools manually via `go install` or `apt`.

**Required Go Tools:**

* **Nuclei** (v3.0+ required): `github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei`
* **Subfinder:** `github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder`
* **Naabu:** `github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/v2/cmd/naabu`
* **Httpx:** `github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx` (Note: Ensure binary is named `httpx-toolkit` on Kali, or alias it).
* **Katana:** `github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/cmd/katana`
* **Gau:** `github.com/bp0lr/gau/v2/cmd/gau`
* **Dalfox:** `github.com/hahwul/dalfox/v2`
* **Trufflehog:** `github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/v3`

**Other Required Tools:**

* **Feroxbuster:** Install via binary release or `apt install feroxbuster`.
* **ParamSpider:** Clone from GitHub (`devanshbatham/ParamSpider`) and install via pip.
* **SecLists:** Ensure SecLists are located at `/usr/share/wordlists/seclists`.

### 4. Verify Installation

Run the built-in validator to ensure all tools are correctly installed.

```bash
python3 main.py --verify

```

## Configuration

Edit `config/config.yaml` to configure Telegram notifications.

```yaml
telegram:
  enabled: true
  bot_token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
  chat_id: "YOUR_CHAT_ID"

```

## Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
python3 main.py start -d <TARGET_DOMAIN> -m <MODE> [FLAGS]

```

### Operational Modes

| Mode | Codename | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ghost** | `ghost` | Slow, Anti-JA3, Rate-limited. | WAF-protected targets. |
| **Ranger** | `ranger` | Balanced speed and depth. | Standard scanning (Default). |
| **Blitz** | `blitz` | Aggressive, Noisy. | CTFs or IP ranges. |

### Examples

```bash
# Standard Scan
python3 main.py start -d example.com -m ranger

# Stealth Scan with Notifications
python3 main.py start -d example.com -m ghost --notify

# Proxy Scan
python3 main.py start -d example.com -p "http://127.0.0.1:8080"

```

## Output Structure

Results are organized by domain and date in the `results/` directory.

```text
results/
└── example.com/
    └── 2023-10-27/
        ├── nuclei_report.txt       # Vulnerabilities
        ├── dalfox_xss.txt          # XSS payloads
        ├── secrets_leak.txt        # Secrets/Keys
        ├── takeover_results.txt    # Subdomain takeovers
